# Objectives

- Write an Express server to handle a `GET` request that returns an object (of any kind) as a response.
- Write a middleware function in a separate JavaScript file that accepts the `req`, `res`, and `next` parameters, adds a property to the `req`, and allows the server to continue on with it's normal operation.
- Pull that module into your main server code and set it up as middleware.
- Use Postman to make the `GET` request and test whether your middleware did its job.
